    This information is used by Edward & Ive for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service,

<p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through 
    Edward & Ive public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Edward & Ive does not read any of your 
    private online communications.</p>

<p>Edward & Ive encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Edward & Ive so 
that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Edward & Ive is not responsible for 
the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Edward & Ive and Edward & Ive family of Web sites.</p>
<br>
<h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Edward & Ive collects and uses your personal information to operate the Edward & Ive Web site and deliver the services you have requested. 
    Edward & Ive also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Edward & Ive and 
    its affiliates. Edward & Ive may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new 
    services that may be offered.</p> 

<p>Edward & Ive does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Edward & Ive may, from time to time, contact you on 
    behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally 
    identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Edward & Ive may 
    share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange 
    for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Edward & Ive, 
    and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

    <p>Edward & Ive does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.</p> 

    <p>Edward & Ive keeps track of the Web sites 
    and pages our customers visit within Edward & Ive, in order to determine what Edward & Ive services are the most popular. 
    This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Edward & Ive to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a 
    particular subject area.</p> 


    <p>Edward & Ive Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to 
    do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal 
    process served on Edward & Ive or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Edward & Ive; and, (c) act under exigent 
    circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Edward & Ive, or the public.</p>
<br>
<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>

<p>The Edward & Ive Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk 
    by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can 
    only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p> 

    <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience 
    feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize 
    Edward & Ive pages, or register with Edward & Ive site or services, a cookie helps Edward & Ive to recall your specific information on 
    subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, 
    and so on. When you return to the same Edward & Ive Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the 
    Edward & Ive features that you customized.</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, 
but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, 
you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Edward & Ive services or Web sites you visit.</p>
<br>
<h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Edward & Ive secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Edward & Ive secures 
the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, 
use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through 
the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<br>
<h3>Changes to this Statement</h3>

<p>Edward & Ive will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. 
    Edward & Ive encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Edward & Ive is protecting your information.</p>
<br>
